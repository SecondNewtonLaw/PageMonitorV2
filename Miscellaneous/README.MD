### RbxStu V3/Miscellaneous

RbxStu V3's Miscellaneous submodule, containing uncategorized and varied abstractions which simply do not fit into any
RbxStu submodule.

- `RbxStu::Miscellaneous::ListenableEvent` a listenable dynamic event that will be fired in a synchronous manner.
- `RbxStu::Miscellaneous::Initializable` an object that can be initialized.

These tools allow for RbxStu's codebase to be more flexible and allow for a neat observer pattern to be written without
major effort.
